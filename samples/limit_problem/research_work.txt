Okay, let's delve into how to find the limit of sin(x)/x as x approaches 0 using Taylor series. This is a classic limit problem, and Taylor series provide a powerful way to solve it.

**Understanding the Problem**

The limit we're trying to find is:

lim (x→0) sin(x) / x

Direct substitution of x = 0 leads to an indeterminate form (0/0), so we need a different approach.

**Taylor Series: A Quick Introduction**

The Taylor series of a function *f(x)* around a point *a* is an infinite sum of terms that express the function as a polynomial. It's given by:

f(x) = f(a) + f'(a)(x-a)/1! + f''(a)(x-a)²/2! + f'''(a)(x-a)³/3! + ...

Where:
*   f'(a), f''(a), f'''(a), ... are the first, second, third, ... derivatives of f(x) evaluated at x = a.
*   n! denotes the factorial of n (e.g., 3! = 3 * 2 * 1 = 6)

For our problem, we will use the Taylor series centered at a = 0, known as the Maclaurin series.

**Deriving the Maclaurin Series for sin(x)**

We need to find the derivatives of sin(x) and evaluate them at x=0.

1.  **f(x) = sin(x)**   
    f(0) = sin(0) = 0
2.  **f'(x) = cos(x)**   
    f'(0) = cos(0) = 1
3.  **f''(x) = -sin(x)**   
    f''(0) = -sin(0) = 0
4.  **f'''(x) = -cos(x)**
    f'''(0) = -cos(0) = -1
5.  **f''''(x) = sin(x)**
    f''''(0) = sin(0) = 0

The pattern repeats every four derivatives: sin(x), cos(x), -sin(x), -cos(x).  Evaluating them at 0 yields a sequence of 0, 1, 0, -1, 0, 1....

Plugging these values into the Maclaurin series formula, we get:

sin(x) = 0 + (1)x/1! + (0)x²/2! + (-1)x³/3! + (0)x⁴/4! + (1)x⁵/5! + ...

This simplifies to:

sin(x) = x - x³/3! + x⁵/5! - x⁷/7! + ...

In sigma notation this can be written as:

sin(x) =  ∑ (-1)ⁿ * x^(2n+1) / (2n+1)!  , n=0 to ∞

**Finding the Limit using Taylor Series**

Now we substitute the Taylor series expansion of sin(x) into our limit expression:

lim (x→0) sin(x) / x   =   lim (x→0) (x - x³/3! + x⁵/5! - x⁷/7! + ... ) / x

We can divide each term in the series by x:

lim (x→0) (1 - x²/3! + x⁴/5! - x⁶/7! + ...)

As x approaches 0, all terms with x in them will approach 0:

lim (x→0) (1 - 0 + 0 - 0 + ...) = 1

Therefore,

lim (x→0) sin(x) / x = 1

**Visualizing the Result**

Graph of y = sin(x)/x,

[Insert image of a graph here, where x is on the horizontal axis and y on vertical axis. The graph should show the function sin(x)/x, that approaches 1 as x approaches zero.  Make sure to note y=1 at x=0, by using an open dot, and the fact that the limit is 1. And, label the axes with x and y and the function name.]

The graph of *y = sin(x)/x* visually confirms our result. As *x* gets closer and closer to 0 from both sides, the function's value gets arbitrarily close to 1.

**Real-Life Relevance**

While the limit sin(x)/x may seem abstract, it has connections to several areas:

*   **Calculus:** It's a fundamental building block in evaluating more complex limits and derivatives.
*   **Physics:** Small-angle approximations in physics often use the fact that for small angles (measured in radians), sin(x) is approximately equal to x. This makes calculations much simpler in situations like simple harmonic motion.
*   **Engineering:** The understanding of limits is essential in control systems, signal processing, and many other engineering disciplines.

**Conclusion**

By utilizing the Taylor series expansion of sin(x), we have shown that:

lim (x→0) sin(x) / x = 1

This technique demonstrates the power of Taylor series to find limits that are difficult to resolve by direct substitution. The result is not just a mathematical curiosity but a vital component in both theoretical and practical applications.
