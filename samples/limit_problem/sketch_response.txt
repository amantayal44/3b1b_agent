  "reasoning": "The problem is to find the limit of sin(x)/x as x approaches 0 using the Taylor series. This is a classic limit problem that cannot be solved by direct substitution, as it results in an indeterminate form (0/0). The solution involves expressing sin(x) as its Taylor series expansion, centered at 0 (Maclaurin series), and then substituting this expansion into the limit expression. By dividing each term of the series by x and then taking the limit as x approaches 0, we find that all terms containing x vanish, leaving only the constant term 1. Therefore, the limit of sin(x)/x as x approaches 0 is 1.
