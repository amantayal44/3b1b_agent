      "animation_details": "Show a long sentence being fed into an RNN one word at a time. Then show a simplified animation of vanishing gradients with the gradient signal weakening as it goes back through time.",
      "animation_style": "Use a color gradient to represent the strength of the gradient signal, fading as it goes back.",
      "audio_text": "This sequential nature made RNNs slow, especially for long sequences. They also suffered from issues like vanishing or exploding gradients, making it hard to learn long-range dependencies in the data."

      "animation_style": "Use bright lines connecting words to represent attention weights. Highlight the words with stronger connections.",
      "audio_text": "The game-changer was the concept of 'Attention'. Instead of processing word by word, attention allows the model to look at all words at once and determine their relationships, avoiding the bottlenecks of RNNs."

      "audio_text": "In Multi-Head Attention, words are first converted into embeddings. Then, for each word, we create Query, Key, and Value vectors using different learned weight matrices. We calculate the attention scores using scaled dot product of Q and K, normalize them using softmax, and then weight the Value vectors by these scores."

      "audio_text": "After attention, a Feed-Forward Network processes each word's output. We also add the input of each layer to its output, which is called a residual connection, and then apply layer normalization to stabilize training."

      "audio_text": "Unlike RNNs, Transformers don't inherently understand word order. To fix this, we add Positional Encodings to the embeddings. These encodings, generated using sine and cosine functions, provide information about each word's position in the sequence."
