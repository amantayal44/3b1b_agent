After a brief pause, start moving the text smoothly towards the left side of the screen, taking about 2 seconds for the transition. Once the text has moved to the left, display a simple rectangular block representing an RNN in the center of the screen. Add a labeled arrow marked "Input" entering the RNN block from the left. Add another labeled arrow exiting the block to the right marked as "Output". Animate a small circle moving along the input arrow, through the RNN block, and out along the output arrow, taking about 2 seconds to complete the path, depicting sequential processing.
