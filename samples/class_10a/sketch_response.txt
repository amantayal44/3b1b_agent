  "reasoning": "The problem is about finding the probability of drawing a card from a bag with cards numbered 1 to 30, under different conditions. We will break down the problem into simpler parts and use visual aids to explain the concept of probability and how to calculate it. \n\n**Scene 1: Introduction**\nIntroduce the problem briefly by showing a bag with 30 cards numbered from 1 to 30. The objective is to find the probability of drawing a card under different conditions, which will be listed.\n\n**Scene 2: Understanding Probability**\nExplain the basic concept of probability, using a simple formula: Probability of an event = (Number of favorable outcomes) / (Total number of possible outcomes). Emphasize that the total number of possible outcomes in this case is 30, as there are 30 cards.\n\n**Scene 3: Probability of Not Divisible by 3**\nFirst, list the numbers from 1 to 30 that are divisible by 3. Then, calculate the numbers that are not divisible by 3 by subtracting the count of divisible numbers from the total. Finally, apply the probability formula to find the probability of drawing a card not divisible by 3.\n\n**Scene 4: Probability of a Prime Number Greater Than 7**\nFirst, explain what a prime number is. Then, list all prime numbers between 1 and 30. Next, identify the prime numbers greater than 7. Finally, use the probability formula to find the probability of drawing a prime number greater than 7.\n\n**Scene 5: Probability of Not a Perfect Square Number**\nFirst, explain what a perfect square number is. Then, list the perfect square numbers between 1 and 30. Next, calculate the numbers that are not perfect squares by subtracting the count of perfect squares from the total. Finally, use the probability formula to find the probability of drawing a card that is not a perfect square.\n\n**Scene 6: Summary of Results**\nSummarize the results obtained in the previous scenes, listing the probabilities for each condition. This will reinforce the understanding of the calculations done.\n\n**Scene 7: Key Concepts Used**\nReview the key concepts used in the video, such as probability, favorable outcomes, total possible outcomes, divisibility, prime numbers, and perfect squares. This will help in consolidating the learning from the video.",
