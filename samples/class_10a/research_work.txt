Okay, let's break down this probability problem step-by-step. We'll cover the concepts, do the calculations, and make sure everything is clear.

**Understanding Probability**

Probability is the measure of how likely an event is to occur. It's calculated as:

```
Probability of an event = (Number of favorable outcomes) / (Total number of possible outcomes)
```

In our case, the total number of possible outcomes is the total number of cards in the bag, which is 30.

**Problem Breakdown**

We have a bag with cards numbered 1 to 30. We need to find the probabilities for these three scenarios:

**(i) Not divisible by 3**
**(ii) A prime number greater than 7**
**(iii) Not a perfect square number**

Let's tackle each one individually.

**(i) Probability of Not Divisible by 3**

*   **Step 1: Find the numbers divisible by 3.**
    These are: 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, 24, 27, and 30.
    There are 10 numbers divisible by 3.
*   **Step 2: Find the numbers NOT divisible by 3.**
    Since there are 30 cards total, the number of cards NOT divisible by 3 is 30 - 10 = 20
*   **Step 3: Calculate the probability.**
    Probability (not divisible by 3) = (Number of cards not divisible by 3) / (Total number of cards)
    Probability (not divisible by 3) = 20 / 30 = 2/3

**Therefore, the probability of drawing a card with a number not divisible by 3 is 2/3.**

**(ii) Probability of a Prime Number Greater Than 7**

*   **Step 1: Identify Prime Numbers.**
    A prime number is a whole number greater than 1 that has only two divisors: 1 and itself. Let's list prime numbers between 1 and 30:
    2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29
*   **Step 2: Identify prime numbers greater than 7**
    From the above list, prime number greater than 7 are:
    11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29
    There are 6 prime numbers greater than 7.
*   **Step 3: Calculate the probability**
    Probability (prime > 7) = (Number of prime numbers > 7) / (Total number of cards)
    Probability (prime > 7) = 6 / 30 = 1/5

**Therefore, the probability of drawing a card with a prime number greater than 7 is 1/5.**

**(iii) Probability of Not a Perfect Square Number**

*   **Step 1: Identify Perfect Square Numbers.**
    A perfect square is a number that is the result of squaring a whole number (e.g., 1 = 1², 4 = 2², 9 = 3²).
    The perfect squares between 1 and 30 are:
    1 (1²), 4 (2²), 9 (3²), 16 (4²), 25 (5²)
    There are 5 perfect squares between 1 and 30.
*   **Step 2: Find the numbers that are NOT perfect squares.**
    The number of cards that are not a perfect square is 30 - 5 = 25.
*   **Step 3: Calculate the probability.**
    Probability (not a perfect square) = (Number of cards not a perfect square) / (Total number of cards)
    Probability (not a perfect square) = 25 / 30 = 5/6

**Therefore, the probability of drawing a card with a number that is not a perfect square is 5/6.**

**Summary of Results**

*   **(i) Probability of not divisible by 3:** 2/3
*   **(ii) Probability of a prime number greater than 7:** 1/5
*   **(iii) Probability of not a perfect square:** 5/6

**Key Concepts Used**

*   **Probability:** The basic concept of calculating the likelihood of an event.
*   **Favorable Outcomes:** The number of outcomes that satisfy the conditions of the event.
*   **Total Possible Outcomes:** The total number of possible outcomes in the sample space.
*   **Divisibility:**  Understanding which numbers are multiples of 3.
*   **Prime Numbers:**  Recognizing prime numbers and their properties.
*   **Perfect Squares:** Identifying numbers that are the squares of whole numbers.
