Okay, let's break down this problem step-by-step and develop a comprehensive explanation. We'll cover the concepts of mass percent, combustion, and empirical formulas to solve this problem effectively.

**Understanding the Problem**

We are given an organic compound with the general formula CxHyOz. We have two key pieces of information:

1.  **Mass Ratio of C and H:** The mass percent of carbon to hydrogen is 6:1. This means that for every 6 grams of carbon, there is 1 gram of hydrogen in the compound.
2.  **Oxygen Content:** The oxygen in the molecule is half of what would be needed to completely burn CxHy to CO2 and H2O.

Our goal is to determine the empirical formula of the compound, which means finding the simplest whole-number ratio of C, H, and O atoms.

**Step-by-Step Solution**

**1. Mass Ratio to Mole Ratio of C and H**

*   **Assume a Basis:** Let's assume we have 100g of the compound. According to the mass ratio, there would be 60g of Carbon and 10g of Hydrogen.
*   **Convert Mass to Moles:**
    *   Moles of Carbon (C) = mass of C / atomic mass of C = 60g / 12 g/mol = 5 mol
    *   Moles of Hydrogen (H) = mass of H / atomic mass of H = 10g / 1 g/mol = 10 mol
*   **Mole Ratio:** The ratio of moles of C to moles of H is 5:10 or 1:2.
    * This means, within the compound's formula, we have a C:H ratio of approximately C1H2. (or CxH2x)

**2. Combustion Reaction and Oxygen Requirement**

*   **General Combustion Reaction:** Let's write the general combustion equation for CxHy:
    ```
    CxHy + (x + y/4)O2  --> xCO2 + (y/2)H2O
    ```

    *   In this balanced equation:
        *   For every molecule of CxHy, we need  (x + y/4) molecules of O2 for complete combustion
        * We get x molecules of CO2 and y/2 molecules of H2O

*   **Considering our C:H ratio:** We determined a C1H2 ratio. Let's assume x=1 and thus, y=2.  Let's use C1H2 (or CH2) as a basis and look at the amount of oxygen needed:
    * CH2 + (1+2/4)O2 --> 1CO2 + 1H2O
    * CH2 + (3/2)O2 --> 1CO2 + 1H2O
    * One molecule of CH2 needs 1.5 molecules of O2 for complete combustion.

**3. Determining Oxygen Content**

*   **Oxygen in the Molecule:** The problem states that one molecule of CxHyOz contains *half* the oxygen needed for complete combustion of  CxHy.

*   **Applying to CH2 :** Since CH2 needs 1.5 molecules of O2, our molecule of CxHyOz contains half this oxygen quantity. This means our molecule contains 0.75 molecules of O2.
*   **Accounting for O Atoms:** Since O2 is a diatomic molecule, 0.75 molecules of O2 = 0.75 * 2 = 1.5 atoms of oxygen (O). Thus, the value of z in our general formula is 1.5.
*   **Re-Writing the Formula:**  The formula becomes  C1H2O1.5

**4. Finding the Empirical Formula**

*   **Whole Number Ratio:** Empirical formulas must have whole number subscripts. To achieve this, we multiply the subscripts by the lowest common multiple (LCM) that will give a whole number. In this case, we have O1.5, so multiply by 2.
*   **Multiply Subscripts by 2:**
    *   C1 * 2 = C2
    *   H2 * 2 = H4
    *   O1.5 * 2 = O3

*   **Empirical Formula:** Therefore, the empirical formula of the compound is C2H4O3.

**Summary**

**Given:**

*   Mass ratio of C:H is 6:1
*   Oxygen content is half of what's needed for complete combustion of CxHy

**Steps:**

1.  **Mass Ratio to Mole Ratio:** C:H mole ratio = 1:2 (or x:2x).
2.  **Combustion:** CxHy + (x+y/4) O2 --> xCO2 + (y/2)H2O. Using the ratio from step 1 (lets say, CH2), 1 molecule of CH2 needs 1.5 molecule of O2 for complete combustion.
3.  **Oxygen Content:** Our molecule contains half this oxygen, which equals 0.75 molecule of O2.
4. **Oxygen atoms:** 0.75 molecule of O2 = 1.5 O atoms
5.  **Initial Formula:** C1H2O1.5
6.  **Empirical Formula:** Multiplying to get whole numbers, C2H4O3

**Final Answer:** The empirical formula of the organic compound is **C2H4O3**.

**Real-Life Relevance**

Understanding empirical formulas is essential in chemistry for several reasons:

*   **Identifying Unknown Compounds:** When analyzing compounds, knowing the empirical formula helps to narrow down the possibilities for the substance.
*   **Predicting Chemical Behavior:** The empirical formula provides information about the elemental composition, which is important for understanding how a substance will react.
*   **Determining Molecular Formula:** The empirical formula is used as a step to calculate molecular formulas, which indicate the exact number of atoms in a molecule.
