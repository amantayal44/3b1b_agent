Okay, let's break down this problem step-by-step. We're dealing with a force field, a displacement along a specific path, and the calculation of work done. Here's a comprehensive research document covering all the necessary concepts and the solution:

**1. Understanding the Concepts**

*   **Force Field:** A force field is a vector field that assigns a force vector to each point in space. In this case, our force field is given by  `F = 2x²y i + 3xy j`, which is a two-dimensional vector field in the xy-plane.  The `i` and `j` represent the unit vectors along the x and y axes respectively.

*   **Work Done by a Force:** In physics, the work done by a force on an object is the energy transferred to or from the object by the application of the force.  When the force is constant and the displacement is a straight line, work is calculated as `W = F · Δr`, where `F` is the force vector, and `Δr` is the displacement vector, and `·` represents the dot product. However, when the force is not constant and/or the displacement is not along a straight line (as in our case), we need to use an integral to calculate the work.

*   **Line Integral:** When a particle moves along a curve, the work done by a force is given by the line integral:
    `W = ∫ F · dr`
    where:
        *   `F` is the force vector.
        *   `dr` is an infinitesimal displacement vector along the curve.
        * The integral is evaluated along the path of motion.

*   **Parametrization of a Curve:** To perform the line integral, we need to represent our curve (the path of motion) using a parameter (e.g., 't'). This means expressing both x and y coordinates of points on the curve as functions of the parameter 't'. This will allow us to express 'dr' in terms of 'dt' and the limits of integration will become the initial and final values of the parameter t.

**2. Setting up the Problem**

*   **Force:** `F = 2x²y i + 3xy j`
*   **Initial Point:** (0, 0)
*   **Final Point:** (1, 4)
*   **Path:**  `y = 4x²`

**3. Parameterizing the Path**

Since our path is given by  `y = 4x²`, we can use 'x' as our parameter.  Let's set `x = t`. Then, `y = 4t²`.  This gives us our parametric equations:
    *   `x(t) = t`
    *   `y(t) = 4t²`

Now, let's find the differential displacement vector `dr` in terms of `dt`
    `r(t) = x(t) i + y(t) j = t i + 4t² j`
    `dr =  (dx/dt) i + (dy/dt) j dt`
    `dr = (1) i + 8t j dt`
    `dr = ( i + 8t j )dt`

*   **Finding Limits for t:**
    *   When the particle is at (0, 0), we have `x = 0`, so `t = 0`.
    *   When the particle is at (1, 4), we have `x = 1`, so `t = 1`.
    Our integration limits for 't' will be from 0 to 1.

**4. Expressing Force in Terms of t**

Now substitute `x = t` and `y = 4t²` into our force equation:
    `F = 2(t²) (4t²) i + 3(t) (4t²) j`
    `F = 8t⁴ i + 12t³ j`

**5. Calculating the Dot Product F · dr**

Now, we can calculate the dot product:
    `F · dr = (8t⁴ i + 12t³ j) · ( i + 8t j ) dt`
    `F · dr = (8t⁴ * 1 + 12t³ * 8t) dt`
    `F · dr = (8t⁴ + 96t⁴) dt`
    `F · dr = 104t⁴ dt`

**6. Evaluating the Line Integral**

Now we can integrate `F · dr` with the limits for `t`:
    `W = ∫ F · dr = ∫(from 0 to 1) 104t⁴ dt`
    `W = 104 [t⁵/5] (from 0 to 1)`
    `W = 104 * (1⁵/5 - 0⁵/5)`
    `W = 104 * (1/5)`
    `W = 20.8`

**Therefore, the work done by the force in displacing the particle from (0,0) to (1,4) along the curve `y=4x²` is 20.8 units.**

**7. Graphical Representation**

While we can't visualize a force field easily, here's a simple graph showing the path of motion in the xy-plane.

    linkStyle 0,1 stroke:red,stroke-width:3px;
    subgraph "y = 4x^2"
    end
```

**Key Points and Insights**

*   The key to solving this problem is to parameterize the curve and convert the line integral into a single variable integral.
*   The work done by a force depends not only on the initial and final points but also on the path taken by the particle.
*   The units of work depend on the units of the force and displacement. If force is in Newtons and displacement is in meters, work will be in Joules.
