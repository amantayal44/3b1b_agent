      "scene_plot": "Introduce the Gaussian distribution. Start with a blank screen and transition to a bell curve graph. Mention that it's also known as the normal distribution and is fundamental in statistics and probability.",
      "animation_details": "Show a standard Gaussian curve with labeled mean (\u03bc) at the center and x-axis representing the random variable. The y-axis represents probability density.",
      "animation_style": "Use a dark background. The Gaussian curve is in light blue. Labels and axes are in white. The mean is marked with a dashed vertical line.",
      "audio_text": "Let's explore the Gaussian distribution, also known as the normal distribution. It's a cornerstone of statistics and probability, and you'll find it almost everywhere in the real world."

      "scene_plot": "Explain the symmetry of the bell curve. Highlight that the mean, median, and mode are equal and located at the center.",
      "animation_details": "Show the same bell curve from Scene 1. Highlight the left and right sides of the curve to demonstrate symmetry around the mean.",
      "animation_style": "Highlight the left side of the curve in light green and the right side in light red momentarily, then revert to the original blue. Keep other styles consistent with Scene 1.",
      "audio_text": "One key feature of the Gaussian distribution is its symmetry. The curve is perfectly symmetrical around its mean. In fact, the mean, median, and mode are all equal and lie right at the center."

      "animation_style": "Use yellow for the curve with smaller standard deviation and purple for the curve with larger standard deviation. Keep other styles consistent.",
      "audio_text": "The spread of the data is determined by the standard deviation. A smaller standard deviation results in a tall, narrow curve, while a larger one gives us a wide, flat curve."

      "audio_text": "Mathematically, the Gaussian distribution is described by its probability density function, or PDF. This formula has two main parts: a scaling factor and an exponential part that gives the curve its shape."

      "animation_details": "Start with a single die and its uniform distribution. Then show the distribution of the sum of two dice, three dice, and so on, until it resembles a bell curve. Show at each step how we are adding more dice.",
      "animation_style": "Use blue bars for the bar graphs representing dice sums. Show each graph in sequence, transitioning smoothly from one to the next. Keep the background dark.",
      "audio_text": "The Central Limit Theorem explains why the Gaussian distribution is so common. It states that the sum of many independent random variables, like rolling multiple dice, tends towards a normal distribution as the number of variables increases."

      "animation_style": "Use simple icons in white next to the text labels. Keep the Gaussian curve in blue and the background dark. Use transition between each example.",
      "audio_text": "The Gaussian distribution appears in many real-world scenarios, such as the distribution of people's heights, IQ scores, and even errors in measurements. It's truly a fundamental concept with wide-reaching applications."
