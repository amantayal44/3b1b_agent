Each dot here represents a house, with its size on the horizontal axis and price on the vertical axis. We need a way to model this relationship."

Solving these, we get the formulas for b\u2081 and b\u2080. Here they are. Don't worry too much about the calculus; what's important is that these formulas give us the slope and y-intercept of the best fit line."
