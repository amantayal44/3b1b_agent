  "reasoning": "The user wants to understand linear regression in machine learning, inspired by the style of 3Blue1Brown videos. We'll create a sketch for an animation that explains linear regression, starting from the basics and gradually building up to the mathematical foundations. \n\n**Scene 1: Introduction**\nWe'll start with a simple, relatable problem: predicting house prices based on their size. This will introduce the concept of using one variable to predict another. The animation will show a scatter plot of house sizes vs. prices, highlighting the need for a model that captures this relationship.\n\n**Scene 2: What is a Line?**\nThis scene will focus on the equation of a line (y = mx + b) and its components. The animation will demonstrate how changing 'm' (slope) and 'b' (y-intercept) affects the line's position and steepness. This lays the groundwork for understanding how a line can model the relationship between variables.\n\n**Scene 3: Defining \"Best Fit\"**\nHere, we introduce the concept of a \"best fit\" line. The animation will show different lines passing through the scatter plot, visually demonstrating that some lines fit the data better than others. We'll introduce the idea of measuring the distance between the actual data points and the predicted values on the line, setting the stage for the concept of error.\n\n**Scene 4: Introducing Errors (Residuals)**\nThis scene will visualize errors as vertical lines from each data point to the regression line. The animation will show how these errors can be positive or negative, and how the goal is to minimize the overall error. This will lead into the idea of the sum of squared errors (SSE).\n\n**Scene 5: Minimizing the Sum of Squared Errors**\nWe'll explain the Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) method visually. The animation will show how squaring the errors makes them all positive and emphasizes larger errors. We'll then introduce the formula for SSE and explain that our goal is to find the values of 'm' and 'b' that minimize this sum.\n\n**Scene 6: Deriving the Formulas for 'm' and 'b'**\nThis scene will walk through the derivation of the formulas for the slope (b₁) and y-intercept (b₀) using calculus. The animation will show each step of the derivation, starting with taking partial derivatives of SSE with respect to b₀ and b₁, setting them to zero, and then solving the simultaneous equations. The final formulas will be presented clearly.\n\n**Scene 7: Multiple Linear Regression**\nThis scene extends the concept to multiple linear regression, where we have more than one independent variable. The animation will show a 3D scatter plot (for two independent variables) and a plane representing the regression model. We will introduce matrix notation and the formula for finding coefficients using matrix calculus.\n\n**Scene 8: Evaluating the Model**\nFinally, we'll introduce metrics for evaluating the model's performance, such as R-squared. The animation will visually explain what R-squared represents, highlighting its range from 0 to 1 and what different values signify. This scene will emphasize the importance of assessing how well the model fits the data.\n\nEach scene will use simple animations, equations, and graphs to explain the concepts, maintaining a consistent style throughout. The audio will provide clear, concise explanations that complement the visuals, ensuring the video is both educational and engaging."
