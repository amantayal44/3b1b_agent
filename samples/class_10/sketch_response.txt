  "reasoning": "The problem involves calculating probabilities related to drawing a card from a bag containing cards numbered 1 to 30. We need to find the probability of drawing a card that is (i) not divisible by 3, (ii) a prime number greater than 7, and (iii) not a perfect square number. To create an engaging and educational animation, we'll follow a step-by-step approach, similar to the 3Blue1Brown style. We will start by introducing the concept of probability, then move on to solve each part of the problem individually, using clear and simple animations. Finally, we will present real life scenarios to make it relatable.\n\n**Scene 1: Introduction to Probability**\nWe'll start by introducing the concept of probability using the basic formula: Probability (Event) = (Number of favorable outcomes) / (Total number of possible outcomes). We'll visually represent this with a simple fraction animation.\n\n**Scene 2: Problem Setup**\nIn this scene, we'll introduce the problem statement: \"Cards numbered 1 to 30 are put in a bag. A card is drawn at random. Find the probability that the number on the drawn card is...\" We'll animate a bag and cards numbered 1 to 30 to visually represent the problem.\n\n**Scene 3: Probability of not divisible by 3**\nHere, we'll first list the numbers divisible by 3 (3, 6, 9, ..., 30) and then calculate the numbers not divisible by 3 (30 - 10 = 20). We'll use simple text animations to show these calculations. Finally, we'll calculate the probability as 20/30 = 2/3, which will be shown visually.\n\n**Scene 4: Probability of a prime number greater than 7**\nWe'll start by defining prime numbers and then list the prime numbers between 1 and 30. We'll highlight the prime numbers greater than 7 (11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29). Finally, we'll calculate the probability as 6/30 = 1/5, visually representing the calculation.\n\n**Scene 5: Probability of not a perfect square number**\nWe'll define perfect square numbers and list the perfect squares between 1 and 30 (1, 4, 9, 16, 25). We'll then calculate the numbers that are not perfect squares (30 - 5 = 25) and finally calculate the probability as 25/30 = 5/6, using animations to show each step.\n\n**Scene 6: Real-life scenario**\nIn this scene, we will present a game scenario where you win based on the card drawn. We will explain the average win rate for each scenario based on the calculated probabilities. This will help in understanding the practical implications of these probabilities.\n\nThroughout the animation, we'll use a consistent style with a dark background and bright, contrasting colors for text and animations. Transitions will be smooth and clear, ensuring that each step of the calculation is easy to follow. The audio will be in simple English, explaining each step clearly and concisely. By following this plan we will create an educational and engaging video similar to 3Blue1Brown style.",
