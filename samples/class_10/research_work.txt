Okay, let's delve into the world of probability and card draws to solve this problem step-by-step.

**Understanding Probability**

Probability is a measure of the likelihood of an event occurring. It's expressed as a number between 0 and 1, where 0 means the event is impossible, and 1 means the event is certain. The basic formula for probability is:

   Probability (Event) =  (Number of favorable outcomes) / (Total number of possible outcomes)

In our case, the "total number of possible outcomes" is the total number of cards in the bag, which is 30.

**Let's break down each part of the problem:**

**(i) Probability of a card not divisible by 3**

**1. Identify Numbers Divisible by 3:**

First, we need to list the numbers between 1 and 30 that are divisible by 3:
   3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, 24, 27, 30

There are 10 numbers divisible by 3.

**2. Identify Numbers Not Divisible by 3:**

Since there are 30 total numbers and 10 are divisible by 3, then the number of cards not divisible by 3 is:
   30 - 10 = 20

**3. Calculate Probability:**
 Probability (not divisible by 3) = (Number of cards not divisible by 3) / (Total number of cards)
    = 20/30
   = 2/3

Therefore, the probability of drawing a card that is not divisible by 3 is 2/3.

**(ii) Probability of a prime number greater than 7**

**1. Understand Prime Numbers**
   A prime number is a whole number greater than 1 that has only two divisors: 1 and itself.

**2. Identify Prime Numbers greater than 7:**
Let's list the prime numbers between 1 and 30:
 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29

Now, we'll pick out the prime numbers that are *greater than 7*:
 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29

There are 6 prime numbers greater than 7 in the bag.

**3. Calculate Probability**
 Probability (prime number > 7) = (Number of prime numbers > 7) / (Total number of cards)
    = 6/30
   = 1/5

Therefore, the probability of drawing a prime number greater than 7 is 1/5.

**(iii) Probability of a card not a perfect square number**

**1. Understand Perfect Square Numbers**
   A perfect square number is a number that can be obtained by squaring a whole number (multiplying a number by itself).

**2. Identify Perfect Square Numbers:**

Let's list perfect square numbers between 1 and 30:
   1 (1*1), 4 (2*2), 9 (3*3), 16 (4*4), 25 (5*5)

There are 5 perfect square numbers.

**3. Identify Numbers not a Perfect Square:**
  Since there are 30 total numbers and 5 are perfect squares, the number of cards that are not perfect squares is:
   30 - 5 = 25

**4. Calculate Probability:**
 Probability (not a perfect square) = (Number of cards not perfect square) / (Total number of cards)
  = 25/30
  = 5/6

Therefore, the probability of drawing a card that is not a perfect square is 5/6.

**Summary of Results:**

*   **(i)** Probability (not divisible by 3) = 2/3
*   **(ii)** Probability (prime number > 7) = 1/5
*   **(iii)** Probability (not a perfect square) = 5/6

**Real-life scenario**
Let's say you are playing a game where you have to draw a card from this bag.

* For scenario (i), if you win whenever the number you draw is not divisible by 3. Then, this means on average you will win 2/3 times the games you play.

* For scenario (ii), if you only win when a prime number greater than 7 is drawn, this means on average you will win 1/5 times the games you play.

* For scenario (iii), if you win when a card drawn is not perfect square, this means on average you will win 5/6 times the games you play.
